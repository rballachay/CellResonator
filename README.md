# Cell Resonator

All code related to work for Dr. Piret at UBC. Project related to image processing for a cell resonator

## Purpose 

This repo uses image analyis to predict cell losses in the top of a cell resonator (a device which uses acoustic waves to capture cells so that they may be washed).

![alt-text-1](docs/gifs/restonator.gif "Î¤he Cell Resonator")

The purpose of this repo is to produce the following plots, plotting the cell counts / sensor data alongside 

## Usage

1. Move the following files in a single folder:

* Excel sheet from template described in docs
* Videos (any of the following)
    * 1 conc / wash video
    * Total video (conc + wash in 1 video) 
    * 2 videos, conc and wash

2. Install requirements from terminal/command line using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(make sure you are inside the CellResonator directory when doing this)

3. Run the package from terminal/command line using

```bash
python -m main "path/to/folder/with/data"
```

The script will run and produce the histograms indicated above
